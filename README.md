# Sliding-CDW-Analysis
Data_reader.py:
Used to format multiple measurement files from a sliding-CDW measurement run. Multiple .csv files are converted into a numpy array indexed by temperature and input current.

toolkit.py:
Multiple useful tools for calculating differential resistivity, electric field, sliding extraconductivity, etc from measurement files. Additionally, multiple tools for plotting sliding measurements.

See C9 Plots.ipynb for an example of this toolkit in action
